# Cyber-Duck Laravel task

Documentation should be kept in the `docs` folder

## Ollie's Notes

Really enjoyed this task so far, I've used Livewire for refreshing the data change on the page, Sail for the local development environment and tried to keep within the foundations listed out in the documentation. (Using Sqlite for DB testing, making use of packages such as Laravel Money, etc)
